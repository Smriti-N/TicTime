# TicTime ⏱️❌⭕

A colourful, animated Tic-Tac-Toe game built with plain **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**. No frameworks, no build step, no installs.

> 🎯 **Hack Day project.** TicTime is *deliberately incomplete*: a few things are broken and a few features are missing. Each one is an issue waiting for you. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

## Screenshots

_Coming soon._

## Run it

You only need a browser.

```bash
git clone <your-fork-url>
cd TicTime
```

Then either double-click `index.html`, or serve the folder (handy if you work on offline/PWA features):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000     # then open http://localhost:8000
# or: npx serve
```

## How to play

1. Player **X** goes first, then players take turns clicking an empty square.
2. Get three of your marks in a row (across, down or diagonally) to win.
3. If all nine squares fill up with no winner, it's a draw.
4. **New Game** clears the board; the scoreboard keeps counting.

## Project structure

```
TicTime/
├── index.html        # page layout
├── css/styles.css    # all styling and animations
└── js/
    ├── game.js       # rules: win/draw detection (no DOM code)
    ├── ui.js         # drawing the board, scores, theme, confetti
    └── main.js       # game state + event handlers
```

## Install and test offline

Serve this folder with a local server, such as VS Code Live Server, and open its
`http://localhost` or `http://127.0.0.1` address. Service workers require localhost
or HTTPS; opening `index.html` as a local file does not enable offline support.

In browser DevTools → Application, check the Manifest and wait for the service
worker to activate. Reload once so the page is controlled, then select Offline
in DevTools → Network and reload again. Play a round and try New Game and the
theme toggle. The font uses the existing system-font fallback without internet.
Use the browser's Install app option when available; the exact location varies
by browser. To clear offline data, use Application → Storage → Clear site data.
When changing cached files, update the cache version in `sw.js`.
